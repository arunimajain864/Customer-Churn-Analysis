# Customer Churn Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior to identify key drivers of churn and builds machine learning models to predict customer churn.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- SQL (MySQL / SQLite)
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## 📂 Dataset
- Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)
- Dataset is not uploaded due to licensing

## 🔍 Project Workflow
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning model building
- SQL-based churn analysis
- Business recommendations

## 🤖 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## 📈 Key Insights
- Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn
- Churned customers have higher monthly charges and lower tenure
- Contract type, tenure, and billing are major churn drivers

## 📌 Business Recommendations
- Promote long-term contracts
- Target high-risk customers with retention offers
- Improve onboarding for new customers
